## GPU-Native Nested Sampling for Modern Simulation-Based Inference

Welcome to the hands-on workshop on nested sampling with BlackJAX! This repository contains materials for a 45-minute workshop delivered at the SBI Galaxy Evolution 2025 conference.

## üéØ Workshop Overview

**Duration:** ~45 minutes  
**Level:** Intermediate (assumes familiarity with JAX and SBI concepts)  
**Platform:** Google Colab (zero installation required)

### What You'll Learn

- Why nested sampling is essential for most SBI methods
- How to use BlackJAX for GPU-native nested sampling
- Professional visualization with Anesthetic
- Performance comparison: nested sampling vs. ensemble samplers
- Hands-on experience with real examples

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended)
Click the "Open in Colab" badge above to run the workshop directly in your browser with zero setup.

### Option 2: Local Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/handley-lab/workshop-blackjax-nested-sampling.git
cd workshop-blackjax-nested-sampling
pip install blackjax[all] anesthetic emcee corner jupyter
jupyter notebook blackjax_nested_sampling_workshop.ipynb
```

## üìö Workshop Content

### 1. Setup & Installation (5 min)
- Quick package installation
- JAX configuration for optimal performance

### 2. Theory: Why Nested Sampling for SBI? (5 min)
- Most SBI methods (NLE, NRE, NJE) require samplers
- BlackJAX advantages: GPU-native, open source, community-driven

### 3. Example 1: Linear Regression (15 min)
- Bayesian linear regression with nested sampling
- Model definition, prior specification, sampling
- Results analysis and interpretation

### 4. Visualization with Anesthetic (10 min)
- Professional corner plots
- Posterior predictive checks
- Publication-quality figures

### 5. Example 2: Multimodal Distribution (5 min)
- Demonstrates nested sampling's strength with complex posteriors
- Mixture of Gaussians example

### 6. Performance Comparison (10 min)
- BlackJAX nested sampling vs. emcee (AIES)
- Timing benchmarks and sample quality
- Model evidence as a bonus feature

### 7. Your Turn: Experiment! (Remaining time)
- Modify examples with your own problems
- Integration with JAX/SciML workflows
- Advanced BlackJAX features

## üîß Key Technologies
