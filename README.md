This interactive workshop demonstrates modern nested sampling using BlackJAX, a GPU-native probabilistic programming library built on JAX. The modular design allows flexible delivery from a 20-minute core workshop to a comprehensive 110-minute session covering advanced topics. Learn how to leverage automatic differentiation and JIT compilation for high-performance Bayesian inference.
